# Unreleased

# 0.3.0

- improved interface for chi input
- FE tests for anisotropic chi and negative chi
- Improve internals
- anisotropic susceptibilities are now allowed.
- Improve susceptibility input possibilities:
  - give susceptibility to parent collection
  - if susceptibility input is scalar, isotropic susceptibility is assumed, if
    it is a 3-vector it can be anisotropic
- Various tests included of interface and computation, isotropic and anisotropic
  tests confirm computation
